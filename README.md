# Obstacle Avoiding Car (No Microcontroller)

Developed as a final project for the Draft and Designing course in 2024, this work emphasizes circuit design, PCB layout, and 3D modeling.

An obstacle-avoiding robotic car built entirely from discrete analog components without using any Arduino or microcontroller. The project showcases comprehensive design documentation including complete schematic diagrams, breadboard layouts for both IR sensor modules and main circuitry, and a custom PCB design rendered in both 2D and 3D formats. 

3D assembly models were created in Autodesk Fusion, demonstrating component placement, integration, and final packaging design. The circuit architecture features LM358 op-amps for signal processing, motor driver and hex inverter ICs for control logic, dual IR sensor modules, passive components for signal conditioning, and a complete power regulation system—all designed and visualized across multiple technical drawing formats including block diagrams, flowcharts, and detailed PCB layouts.
